# Sleigh Me: a Secret Santa app
An app to play Secret Santa with remote friends and family

## General information
This is my final capstone project after a yearlong software development bootcamp at Nashville Software School. The app allows a user to create a team of other users to play Secret Santa with. Once the team is assembled, the team owner can click a button to randomly assign partners to all group members. Users are alerted in app of who their parter is, and only that group member sees who their partner is. Users also have the opportunity to update a profile for gift preferences and their address, should the gift need to be mailed. Only the current user and his/her assigned partners are able to see that address. 

This project features full CRUD capabilities. The login and registration code were provided by NSS as authentication is not an objective of the class. Design is inspired by Material UI elements.
